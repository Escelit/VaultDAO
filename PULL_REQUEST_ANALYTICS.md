### 📝 Description

Adds a comprehensive **Analytics dashboard** with charts, graphs, and insights for vault activity. Users can view proposal trends over time, spending breakdown by token/recipient, signer activity patterns, and treasury/cumulative volume. The page includes a time range selector (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all), statistics cards (approval rate, average approval time, most active signer, top recipient, total volume), an automated insights section, and export (CSV + chart as image). All visualizations are built with Recharts and are mobile responsive.

**Highlights:**
- Proposal trends line chart (created / approved / executed over time)
- Spending breakdown pie chart by token/recipient
- Signer activity heatmap (approvals by signer and period)
- Treasury / cumulative volume line chart
- Stats cards and color-coded insights
- Export analytics to CSV and export chart as PNG (via html2canvas)
- Data aggregation utilities for proposal trends, spending, signer activity, and stats
- Responsive layout: 1 column (mobile), 2 (tablet), 3–4 (desktop)
